# Verjaardagskalendar...ly 
A light-hearted digital version of the classic Dutch birthday calendar. You can create a new account or log in to an existing account, create your user profile, add your contacts and their birthdays, and view those events in your calendar. Never forget a birthday again!

## Architecture
This project was built with a React.js frontend, a Ruby on Rails API, and a PostgreSQL database.

## Set up
Start by cloning this repository and navigating to the project folder. 


To install backend dependencies, process the migrations, and seed the database, run these commands:

`bundle install`

`rails db:migrate db:seed`

Then, start up the rails server by running: 

`rails s`


Next, navigate into the client folder, and run these commands to install frontend dependencies and start up the React app:

`npm install`

`npm start`


Now you are all set to log in to the app!
